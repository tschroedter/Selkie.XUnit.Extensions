# Selkie
Selkie.EasyNetQ is part of the Selkie project which is based on Castle Windsor and EasyNetQ. The main goal of the Selkie project is to calculate and displays the shortest path for a boat travelling along survey lines from point A to B. The algorithm takes into account the minimum required turn circle of a vessel required to navigate from one line to another.

The project started as a little ant colony optimization application. Over time the application grew and was split up into different services which communicate via RabbitMQ. The whole project is used to try out TDD, BDD, DRY and SOLID.
